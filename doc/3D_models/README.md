# 3D models

 his directory serves as the central repository for managing and organizing 3D model components, and calculation sheets used in the CubeSat project. The resources provided here support the development, iteration, and documentation of the mechanical aspects of the project.

## Model Development:

This section provides a chronological record of development.

### Release 2024-12-18

#### Prats:
- Slit sensor face v6
- Slit sensor face lid v1
- Frame stick v1

#### Nodes:
The faces are too wide, so the sticks front walls are too thin. The face needs to be modelled a little smaller. The sticks need a margin error at the joint of the faces. The Face lid has not been printed.
